# Interactive Data Analytics Platform

An interactive platform built using **Streamlit** for exploring, analyzing, and visualizing datasets. This app allows users to upload CSV or Excel files, perform statistical analysis, filter rows, and apply machine learning models (regression and classification) for predictive insights. Dynamic visualizations powered by **Plotly** make data exploration intuitive and engaging.

## Features

- **Data Upload**: Supports CSV and Excel file uploads.
- **Statistical Summaries**: Displays dataset shape, summary statistics, and data types.
- **Data Exploration**: Filter top and bottom rows, perform group-by operations.
- **Dynamic Visualizations**: Visualize data with Plotly charts (line, bar, scatter, pie, sunburst).
- **Machine Learning**: Apply regression and classification models to analyze data.
- **Model Results**: Display performance metrics like Mean Squared Error (for regression) and Accuracy Score (for classification).

## Deployment

The app is live and accessible at [mydatanalytics](https://mydatanlytics.streamlit.app/).
