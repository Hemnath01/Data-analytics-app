# Interactive Data Analytics Platform

An interactive platform built using **Streamlit** for exploring, analyzing, preprocessing, and visualizing datasets. This app allows users to upload CSV or Excel files, perform data preprocessing, statistical analysis, filter rows, and apply machine learning models (regression and classification) for predictive insights. Dynamic visualizations powered by **Plotly** make data exploration intuitive and engaging.

## Features

- **Data Upload**: Supports CSV and Excel file uploads.
- **Data Preprocessing**: 
  - Handle missing values (remove, replace with mean/median/mode).
  - Perform data encoding (label encoding, one-hot encoding).
  - Normalize or standardize numerical data for better model performance.
- **Statistical Summaries**: Displays dataset shape, summary statistics, and data types.
- **Data Exploration**: Filter top and bottom rows, perform group-by operations.
- **Dynamic Visualizations**: Visualize data with Plotly charts (line, bar, scatter, pie, sunburst).
- **Machine Learning**: Apply regression and classification models to analyze data.
- **Model Results**: Display performance metrics like Mean Squared Error (for regression) and Accuracy Score (for classification).

## Deployment

The app is live and accessible at [mydatanalytics](https://mydatanlytics.streamlit.app/).

## Requirements

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Pandas**
- **Plotly**
- **Streamlit**
- **SciKitLearn**
- **OpenPyXL** (for Excel file support)

## Upcoming Features
- Enhanced preprocessing options, including advanced outlier detection and feature engineering.
- Support for real-time collaborative data exploration.
